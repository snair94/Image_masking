Image Masking – AI Challenge Brief 2

This project is a semantic segmentation web app that allows users to upload a product image, provide a text prompt to identify an item within the image, and apply a solid-colored mask to the segmented region. The user can download the masked image or the binary mask.
Built using Gradio and the CLIPSeg model by CIDAS.
________________________________________Features
Upload any product image (clothing, cans, shoes, etc.)
Input a prompt like "shirt", "label", "logo", "bottle" to mask a specific part of the image
Select any color for the mask using a color picker
View and download the masked image or the binary mask
Simple, clean UI powered by Gradio

________________________________________Setup Instructions
1. Clone the Repository
2. Create a Python Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)
3. Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
Gradio will automatically launch the app in your browser at http://localhost:7860.
________________________________________Dependencies
All dependencies are listed in requirements.txt. Key packages include:
transformers
gradio
Pillow
torch
matplotlib
opencv-python
Install all with:
pip install -r requirements.txt
________________________________________Testing (Manual)
Since this is a front-end tool:
Launch the app.
Upload a sample product image.
Use prompts like "bottle", "label", "can", "shirt" to test segmentation.
Try with various mask colors.
Confirm the output image shows a correctly colored overlay and that it is downloadable.
________________________________________Notes
The segmentation model is zero-shot, meaning it works without needing a labeled dataset.
Ensure the prompt is accurate and clearly refers to a visual object in the image for best results.
Mask quality can vary depending on image complexity and prompt specificity.
Use images of .png or .jpeg format
________________________________________Future Improvements
Provide options to download the binary mask separately.
Add mask transparency controls.
Add support for multi-label prompts (e.g., "shirt and jeans").
Export results in .png with alpha channel for design workflows.
